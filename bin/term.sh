#
# Open a new Mac OS X terminal window or tab in the current or another
# directory and optionally run a command in the new window or tab.
#
# - Without any arguments, the new terminal window opens in
#   the current directory, i.e. the executed command is "cd $PWD".
# - If the first argument is a directory, the new terminal will "cd" into
#   that directory before executing the remaining arguments as command.
# - The optional "-t" flag executes the command in a new tab
#   instead of a new window.
# - The optional "-x" flag closes the new window or tab
#   after the executed command finishes.
# - The optional "-p" flag takes an argument of the form x,y (e.g. 40,50) and
#   positions the terminal window to the indicated location on the screen
# - The optional "-s" flag takes an argument of the form w,h (e.g. 800,400) and
#   resizes the terminal window to the indicated width and height in pixels.
