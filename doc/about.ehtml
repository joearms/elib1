  <p>Elib1 is a library of Erlang modules, together with a number of
  complete applications built using the library. The applications have
  been co-developed with the library. The test of any library is
  <i>are the library functions useful?</i> The only way to answer
  this is to write a largish number of applications using the library
  functions.  If the applications are useful and if they reuse large
  amounts of library code then the library is probably OK, otherwise
  not.</p>

  <p>Usually when we write an application we often get to a point
  where we think, "Oh dear the libraries are wrong." What we should
  really do is stop work on the application, fix up the libraries then
  return to the application. Now while this is what we <i>should</i>
  do, we rarely do this in practice since we are keen to get the
  application finished.</p>

  <p>In writing the applications I have strictly followed the
  principle: <i>If In find anything wrong with the libraries, then go
  fix the libraries and return to the application</i>. This of course
  breaks all the other application that depend on the libraries, so
  I've had a spend end a lot of time fixing up the breakages.</p>
