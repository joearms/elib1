  <h1>Wanted</h1>

  <P>This section is for <i>wanted programs</i>. These are programs that are
  wanted but not yet written.</P>

  <h2>The life cycle of a program</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>You check the library - what you want is missing.</li>
    <li>You choose a sensible name for your module, we'll call it
    MYNAME here.</li>
    <li>You fork the library and add a module stub in
    <b>/wanted/src/elib1_MYNAME.erl</b> You write some
    edoc annotations to say what you want and why</li>
    <li>For longer requests you write a request and put it in
    <b>/wanted/notes/MYNAME.ehtml</b></li>
    <li>You request that the form be pulled into the main branch</li>
    <li>The moderator accepts or rejects the request</li>
    <li>If accepted, sooner of later somebody starts work on your code</li>
    <li>The code matures (in a forked version)</li>
    <li>A request is made to move the code to the supported, unsupported or
    lib branch of the library.</li>
  </ol>
