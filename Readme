	Elib1

	An Erlang library and collection of applications

You will also have to do the following:

    1) add a path to your ${HOME}/.erlang
       code:add_patha(".../elib1-3/lib/ebin").

    2) add path to your .bash_profile (on a mac)
       export PATH=/Users/joe/code/elib2-1/bin:$PATH

    3) make eindex and executable
       chmod u+x elib1-3/bin/einidex
       chnod u+x elib1-3/bin/elib2_find_similar_files

Then make to compile the library and view
the documentation.

This should start a web server on port 

If it doesn't point your browser at:

    http://localhost:2246/supported/website/index.ehtml

Note - I have only tested this with firefox
